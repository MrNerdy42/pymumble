PYMUMBLE python library
=======================

Description
-----------

This is a fork of the the library [](https://github.com/azlux/pymumble). Most of the documentation and work is his. I created this fork to fix a few bugs that made it unuseable for me.

Requirements/installation
-------------------------

Check the `requirement.txt` to know the versions of `opuslib` and `protobuf` needed.
You need `pip3` because it's a Python 3 library (`apt-get install python3-pip`) to install dependencies (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).
